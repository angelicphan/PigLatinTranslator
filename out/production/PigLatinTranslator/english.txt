Hello my name is Angelic Phan. 
This is my Pig Latin translator. 
It will encode or decode any input text to/from Pig Latin. 
This may not be the best program out there, but it's for me to practice working 
with Java again. 
I hope you have fun! 
Sequence of symbols: *()^*%%$$ okay okay 
Math: (34 + 24) whoohoo 
leading and ending: (hello)
